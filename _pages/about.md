I am a Reader in Control Engineering and Cyber-Physical systems at London Metropolitan University. Before joining London Metropolitan, I was with the Electrical Engineering Department at the Federal University of São João del-Rei - UFSJ, Brazil (2016-2023). I held postdoctoral research positions at the University of Campinas, and the Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics Department at, the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA. I was awarded my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC) at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) in 2014. 

My main research interests include constrained control, LPV systems, and cyber-physical systems. The main focus of my research is the development of conditions for analysis and robust control design for systems under constraints. Nowadays, I am particularly interested in the study of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the presence of attacks in communication channels. It is important to highlight that CPS encloses several areas of interest, such as human-in-the-loop, real-time control, the Internet of Things, and machine-to-machine communication, among others. In 2021, I  received the Fellowship of Research Productivity from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development. I am an Associate Editor for the Journal of Control Automation and Electrical Systems and a member of the IEEE Conference Editorial Board  (CEB) and IEEE Technology Conference Editorial Board (TCEB).
